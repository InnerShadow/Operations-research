# RFE BSU operations research labs 

1. [Lab 1](/Lab1/) is a simple R function detouch, plotting graphics, find optimus, solve some simple equations.
2. [Lab2](/Lab2/) task : find the data placement on computational stations in a distributed computing network based on clusters (see Figure 1). Conduct an analysis of constraints. Solve optimizations task using lpSolve and lpSolveAPI.
