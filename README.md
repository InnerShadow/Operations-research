# RFE BSU operations research labs 

## 1. [Lab 1](/Lab1/) is a simple R function detouch, plotting graphics, find optimus, solve some simple equations.
## 2. [Lab 2](/Lab2/) task : find the data placement on computational stations in a distributed computing network based on clusters. Conduct an analysis of constraints. Solve optimizations task using lpSolve and lpSolveAPI.
## 3. [Lab3](/Lab3/) task: find *r* fastes routs in graph uing simplex method with binnary varibals.
## 4. [Lab4](/Lab4/) is a solutions for multidimensional minimization problems (including constrained and unconstrained) of functions with two or more variables were implemented using the optimise, nloptr, and optimx libraries.
